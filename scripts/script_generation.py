        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Ughhh… worst freakin’ round of my life, Stewie. I lost six balls, I topped like ten drives, and I triple-bogeyed a freakin’ par 3! I swear the golf gods hate me."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Or perhaps it was your catastrophic decision-making and fragile mental state under pressure. But sure, blame the gods."},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "I don’t get it! I was hittin’ bombs on the range this morning. Then soon as I get on the course, it’s like my clubs turn to spaghetti."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "It’s called course management, you oaf. You play smart, not like a reckless Viking on a bender. Let’s review your crimes against golf etiquette, shall we?"},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Yeah, lay it on me, Stew."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Hole 3 — tight fairway, water on the right. What do you do?"},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Pulled out the driver. I mean, gotta show off the big stick, right?"},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Wrong. You should’ve hit a hybrid or a 5-iron, kept it in play, and saved yourself two penalty strokes and an embarrassing dive into the pond to retrieve your ball."},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Yeah… yeah okay, that makes sense."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Hole 7 — downhill par 3, wind in your face. You chose a club based on what, gut instinct?"},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Well… yeah. I felt like an 8-iron vibe, ya know?"},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "And you came up thirty yards short. Ever heard of checking the wind, elevation, and yardage? Or using a freakin’ rangefinder?"},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Alright, alright. Note to self: less vibes, more math."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "And your biggest sin — your mental game. After your first bad hole, you completely unraveled. Tossed your club, yelled something about Lois’s meatloaf, and played the next three holes like a man possessed."},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Yeah… I got in my own head, didn’t I?"},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Indeed. Golf’s a war of attrition, Peter. You must master your emotions. Bad shot? Forget it. Bad hole? It’s history. Play the next one fresh. Emotional fortitude separates golfers from… well, guys like you."},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Dang, Stewie… you’re like a tiny British Yoda. I never thought about it like that. Stay calm, play smart, pick the right club… huh."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Now you’re catching on. Next round, think strategy. Think percentages. Think… ‘What would Stewie do?’"},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Heheheh… yeah. And maybe leave the driver in the bag once in a while, huh?"},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Only if you value dignity."},
        {"character": "Peter", "text": "Alright, next time I’m gettin’ you your own set of baby clubs, and we’re goin’ head-to-head. Loser buys juice boxes."},
        {"character": "Stewie", "text": "Prepare to be bankrupted, fat man."}
